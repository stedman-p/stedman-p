Hello folks, 19-year-old computer science student at the University of Cincinnati here.
I enjoy playing the piano, discovering new artists on Spotify, yearly Lord of the Rings re-reads, playing Mount and Blade, and sitting outside watching my chickens.

I took some low-quality coding courses in middle school, but taking AP CSP my senior year of high school really piqued my interest in the field
I currently have knowledge in Python and C++ through my university classes and personal projects, and hope to start learning some web development knowledge soon!
